Title: An R Package for Calculating Single Allele Divergence Matrices Between and Within Taxa
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Roberto Carrera-Martínez
Maintainer: Roberto Carrera-Martínez <rcarrmart@gmail.com>
Description: SLDivMaxR is a straightforward R package designed to calculate genetic divergence (or distance) for single alleles at each sequence level, defined by user-specified groups (such as species, subspecies, lineages, haplotypes, etc.), as well as within each defined group. The package is optimized for analyzing large datasets, enhancing replicability, and producing outputs in a data.frame format. Built upon the ape function dist.dna to compute genetic divergence and the vegan function meandist for calculating mean divergence between and within groups, SLDivMaxR simplifies the manual designation of groups required by other commonly used software. This makes it a useful tool for large datasets and can be seamlessly integrated into more complex population genetics analyses.
