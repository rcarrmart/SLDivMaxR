Description: SLDivMaxR is a simple package that allows calculation of divergence (or distance) on a single allele at each sequence level, by defined groups (which can be species, subspecies, lineagesm, haplotypes, etc.) and within each defined groups. The package was designed to analize large datasets, increase replicability, and produce outputs in a data.frame format. SLDivMaxR is built upon the ape funtion dist.dna to calculate genetic divergence and the vegan funtion meandist to calculate mean divergence between and within groups. This approach shortcots manual designation of groups in other commonly used softwares, and has potential to be used sistematically in large datasets and as part of more complex population genetics analises.
