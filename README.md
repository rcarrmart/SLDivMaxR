# SLDivMaxR v. 0.1.0
### A R Package for Calculating Single Allele Divergence Matrices Between and Within Taxa

## Package Summary
`SLDivMaxR` is a straightforward R package designed to calculate genetic divergence (or distance) for single alleles at each sequence level, defined by user-specified groups (such as species, subspecies, lineages, haplotypes, etc.), as well as within each defined group. The package is optimized for analyzing large datasets, enhancing replicability, and producing outputs in a `data.frame` format. Built upon the `ape` function `dist.dna` to compute genetic divergence and the `vegan` function `meandist` for calculating mean divergence between and within groups, SLDivMaxR simplifies the manual designation of groups required by other commonly used software. This makes it a useful tool for large datasets and can be seamlessly integrated into more complex population genetics analyses.

## Instalation
Make sure to have `devtools` package installed. 
```{r}
install.packages("devtools") 
```
To install `SLDivMaxR` simply run: 
```{r}
devtools::install_github("rcarrmart/SLDivMaxR") 
```
Packages `ape` and `vegan` will be needed. 

## Functions Overlook
The package currently has six funtions. 
### `Dist2DF.Long`: `dist` to `data.frame` long format conversion
A function to change the data class from `dist` to `data.frame` in long format. 
```{r}
Dist2DF.Long(inDist,
             Convert100 = FALSE)
```
The input for the function (`inDist`) should be a matrix of class `dist`, such as the output from `ape::dist.dna`. The output can be converted to percentages if the input is in proportions and `Convert100 = TRUE`. By default, when `Convert100 = FALSE`, the output will remain unchanged.


Example: 
```{r}
library(ape)
test.dist <- dist.dna(test.DNA)

Dist.df <- Dist2DF.Long(test.dist)

Dist.df.100 <- Dist2DF.Long(test.dist, Convert100 = TRUE)

Dist.df.100x <- Dist2DF.Long(test.dist*100) # equivalent to `Convert100 = TRUE
```

### `Dist2DF.Wide`: `dist` to `data.frame` wide format conversion
A function to change the data class from `dist` to `data.frame` in wide format. 
```{r}
Dist2DF.Wide(inDist,
             Convert100 = FALSE)
```
The input for the function (`inDist`) should be a matrix of class `dist`, such as the output from `ape::dist.dna`. The output can be converted to percentages if the input is in proportions and `Convert100 = TRUE`. By default, when `Convert100 = FALSE`, the output will remain unchanged.

Example: 
```{r}
library(ape)
test.dist <- dist.dna(test.DNA)

Dist.df <- Dist2DF.Wide(test.dist)

Dist.df.100 <- Dist2DF.Wide(test.dist, Convert100 = TRUE)

Dist.df.100x <- Dist2DF.Wide(test.dist*100) # equivalent to `Convert100 = TRUE
```
### `Dist2DF.Groups`: Mean Distances between Group
Applies `hclust` and `cutree` to a matrix of class `"dist"` to cluster samples by a  maximum distance threshold or to a set number of groups.
```
Dist2DF.Groups(inDist,
               Convert100 = FALSE,
               get.group = NULL,
               n.groups = NULL,
               method = "PW",
               G.Name = "group")
````
`Dist2DF.Groups` takes a distance matrix (`inDist`) and calculates the mean distances between distinct groups. It does this either by using the maximum divergence threshold between sequences (via the `get.group` argument, with either `method` options) or by creating _N_ groups, regardless of within-group divergences (via the `n.groups` argument, and `method = "CT"`). 

Example: 
```{r}
test.dist <- dist.dna(test.DNA)

# threshold of 0.7 
dist.g.prop0.7 <- Dist2DF.Groups(test.dist, get.group = 0.7) 

# threshold of 7%
dist.g.per7 <- Dist2DF.Groups(test.dist, get.group = 7, Convert100 = TRUE)  

# threshold of 10% using the `hclust` and `cutree` approach
# Setting group names to "Species"
bySpecies <- Dist2DF.Groups(test.dist, get.group = 10, Convert100 = T,
                             method = "CT", G.Name = "Species")

# Cluster to 3 groups
Dist2DF.Groups(test.dist, n.groups = 3, Convert100 = T, method = "CT")
```
### `DNA.Dist.df`: Single locus divergence data.frame
Applies `ape::dist.dna()` but changes `"dist"` class output from `ape::dist.dna()` to `data.frame`.

```{r}
DNA.Dist.df(inDNA,
            Dist.type = "percent",
            Out.Format = "long",
            Model = "K80",
            GAMMA = FALSE,
            PW.deletion = TRUE,
            Var = FALSE,
            by.group = NULL,
            group.summary = FALSE,
            within.group = FALSE)
```
**Arguments: **
**`inDNA`**: The input aligned sequences in `.fasta` format.

**`Dist.type`**: Specifies the distance output format. Options are: `"prop"`: Proportions; `"percentage"`: Percentages; and `"nucleotide"`: Number of nucleotides that are different.

**`Model`**: Specifies the evolutionary model to use, as in `ape::dist.dna`. Options include: `"RAW"`, `"JC69"`, `"K80"` (default), `"F81"`, `"K81"`, `"F84"`, `"T92"`, `"TN93"`, `"GG95"`, `"LOGDET"`, `"BH87"`, `"PARALIN"`, `"N"`, `"TS"`, `"TV"`, `"INDEL"`, and `"INDELBLOCK"`. Note: If `Model = "N"` and `Dist.type` is set to `"prop"` or `"percentage"`, an error will be returned.

**`GAMMA`**: Same as the `gamma` parameter in `ape::dist.dna()`.

**`PW.deletion`**: Specifies whether pairwise deletion should be considered (`TRUE`, default) or not (`FALSE`).

**`Var`**: If `TRUE`, the output will include calculated variation. Default is `FALSE`.

**`by.group`**: A vector for grouping sequences into different categories (e.g., populations, species, lineages). The order should match the sequence alignment and be used with `vegan::meandist()`.

**`group.summary`**: Applies `vegan::meandist()` to generate a `data.frame` with within-group mean distance, between-group mean distance, and overall distance. A vector with discrete groupings should be provided in `by.group`.

**`within.group`**: Applies `vegan::meandist()` to create a `data.frame` with each groupâ€™s mean divergence and the number of samples ("N") by group. A vector with discrete groupings should be provided in `by.group`. Groups with `N = 1` will return `NA`s.

Examples:
```{r}
# Distance matrix class == data.frame of all specimens
DNA.Dist.df(test.DNA, Out.Format = "wide")

# same as above but with JC96 model
DNA.Dist.df(test.DNA, Out.Format = "wide", Model = "JC69")

# as above, but long pair-wise comparison format
DNA.Dist.df(test.DNA, Out.Format = "long", Model = "JC69")

####
# Defining groupings
####
#create data.frame with specimen and grouping (e.g., species) IDs
Species.info <- data.frame(Specimen = paste0("Ind",LETTERS[1:9]),
                           Species = paste0("Sp",c(rep(1,3),rep(2,3),rep(3,3))),
                            Seq.names = names(test.DNA))

Species.info  # Check that they match.
# The funtion uses the order of the `by.group` vector to group the sequences

DNA.Dist.df(test.DNA, Out.Format = "long", Model = "JC69", by.group = Species.info$Species)

# Reorganize the output 
Comparison <- DNA.Dist.df(test.DNA, Out.Format = "long", Model = "JC69", by.group = Species.info$Species)
Comparison <- data.frame(Pairs = paste(Comparison$x1, Comparison$x2, sep = "_vs_"),
                         Distance = Comparison$Distance)
Comparison

#wide format
WDist <- DNA.Dist.df(test.DNA, Out.Format = "wide", Model = "JC69", by.group = Species.info$Species)
WDist
```


### `SE`: Standard Error 
Calculates standard error on a vector `x`. 
```{r}
SE(x)
```
`SE` automatically ignores missing data (`NA`'s). `x` must be a numeric vector. 

Example:
```{r}
a <- c(1:10)
SE(a)

a <- c(1:10, NA, NA)
SE(a)

a <- c(NA, NA, NA)
SE(a)
```

### `DNA.GroupDist.SE`: Divergence Standard Error between and within groups
Calculates standard error of specified between and within group genetic divergences. The funtion applies a modified version of `vegan::meandist` to calculate the Standard Error of the divergences calculated by `DNA.Dist.df`. 

```{r}
DNA.GroupDist.SE(inDNA,
                 Dist.type = "percent",
                 Out.Format = "long",
                 Model = "K80",
                 GAMMA = FALSE,
                 PW.deletion = TRUE,
                 by.group,
                 within.group = FALSE)
```
**Arguments:**
**`inDNA`**: The input aligned sequences in `.fasta` format.

**`Dist.type`**: Specifies the distance output format. Options are `"prop"`: Proportions; `"percentage"`: Percentages; and `"nucleotide"`: Number of nucleotides that differ.

**`Model`**: Specifies the evolutionary model to use, as in `ape::dist.dna`. Options include: `"RAW"`, `"JC69"`, `"K80"` (default), `"F81"`, `"K81"`, `"F84"`, `"T92"`, `"TN93"`, `"GG95"`, `"LOGDET"`, `"BH87"`, `"PARALIN"`, `"N"`, `"TS"`, `"TV"`, `"INDEL"`, and `"INDELBLOCK"`. Note: If `Model = "N"` and `Dist.type` is set to `"prop"` or `"percentage"`, an error will be returned.

**`GAMMA`**: Same as the `gamma` parameter in `ape::dist.dna()`.

**`PW.deletion`**: Specifies whether pairwise deletion should be considered (`TRUE`, default) or not (`FALSE`).

**`by.group`**: A vector for grouping sequences into different categories (e.g., populations, species, lineages). The vector should follow the same order as the sequence alignment.

**`within.group`**: Creates a `data.frame` with the within-group standard error and the number of samples ("N") by group. A vector with discrete groupings should be provided in `by.group`. Groups with `N = 1` will return `NA`s.


Example:
```{r}
# Defining groupings
####
#create data.frame with specimen and grouping (e.g., species) IDs
Species.info <- data.frame(Specimen = paste0("Ind",LETTERS[1:9]),
                           Species = paste0("Sp",c(rep(1,3),rep(2,3),rep(3,3))),
                           Seq.names = names(test.DNA))

Species.info  # Check that they match.
# The funtion uses the order of the `by.group` vector to group the sequences

DNA.GroupDist.SE(test.DNA, Out.Format = "long", Model = "JC69", by.group = Species.info$Species)

# Reorganize the output 
CompSE<- DNA.GroupDist.SE(test.DNA, Out.Format = "long", Model = "JC69", by.group = Species.info$Species)
CompSE <- data.frame(Pairs = paste(CompSE$x1, CompSE$x2, sep = "_vs_"),
                         SE = CompSE$Standard_Error)
CompSE

#wide format
WDistSE <- DNA.GroupDist.SE(test.DNA, Out.Format = "wide", Model = "JC69", by.group = Species.info$Species)
WDistSE
```
